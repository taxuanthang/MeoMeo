# LIBRARIES
we use common libraries include: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, itertools, sklearn.metrics, math, time, PIL, pickle, random, cv2, os, sklearn.model_selection

We are using pycharm, the simple way to import these module is going into the package and import it same to the name to the env. folder

Maybe when you using u will meet some error to torchvision, and some module such as my pickle right here, you can check the suitable version for it because the new version of module have delete some function from the old one so might be a chance that the old project only work with the old module, and unfortunately the old module can't run on the new version of python. You can solve this by install the old python on the other environment on your computer.
Thanks for being patient to read to here, Mrs.Hai is the best
